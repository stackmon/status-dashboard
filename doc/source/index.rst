Status Dashboard
================

Status Dashboard as part of the StackMon project. It is a tiny Flask web
application that is supposed to visualize all incidents in the monitored
system, allow opening or updating incidents, schedule maintenance windows.
StatusDashboard is designed with simplicity in mind to allow easy maintenance
and extension for custom needs. It is currently not pretending to be a fully
feature-blown Status Dashboard for any possible usecase.
